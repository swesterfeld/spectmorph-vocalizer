 - for short notes, both vowel and consonants need to be shortened
 - diphthongs 80/20 rule (or something?)
 - detect long vowels and use a_a (or similar) for those
 - record humming m_m, ...
 - melisma frequency bend: should we use a slide instead of a frequency jump
 - whispering voice

possible improvements for quality:
- use harmonic resynthesis only for voiced consonants and vowels
- enable noise synthesis for voiceless fricatives only

test cases:
 - extra test case for extremely short notes
 - extra test case for "h" consonant
 - staccato at end + rest test case
