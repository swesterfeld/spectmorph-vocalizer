 - add extra labels for "bad" diphones, avoid using these in synthesis (i.e. "!")
 - for short notes, both vowel and consonants need to be shortened
 - diphthongs 80/20 rule (or something?)
 - detect long vowels and use a_a (or similar) for those
 - record "_haha" diphones, maybe use "_h", use "ha", "ah"
 - record humming m_m, ...
 - glottal stop ("?") labeling
 - melisma frequency bend: should we use a slide instead of a frequency jump

test cases:
 - extra test case for extremely short notes
 - extra test case for "h" consonant
 - staccato at end + rest test case
